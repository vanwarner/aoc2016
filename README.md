# aoc2016

aoc2016 holds my attempts at completing Advent of Code 2016 to ~~re~~learn Rust. I make no declaration that any of this is idiomatic, best-practice, or even good. But maybe I'll stick with it for more than a week this time...

## Installation

Requires (Rust)[https://www.rust-lang.org] \(duh\). 

## Usage

Build with `cargo build`, unless you're better than I am with Rust and know to build for release or whatever.

Specify the day to run as the first argument to `cargo run`, and the part of that day with `-p`. 
```rust
cargo run 2 // runs day 2, part 1
cargo run 4 -p // runs day 4, part 2
```

Why?

Yell at me for bad code on (my Twitter)[https://twitter.com/izeryx].
